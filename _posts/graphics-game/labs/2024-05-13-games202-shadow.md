    > **Self-Occlussion**
    > Self-occlusion may result from floating-point calculation errors or occur when objects are two-sided and both sides occupy the same location. Therefore, a small bias is necessary to prevent the artifacts caused by this.
    > 
    > **Light Leaks / Peter Panning**
    > Too much bias causes this problem, in which the object appears to float slightly above the underlying surface.

## Render Result

### Shadowing Methods

#### Hard Shadow based on Shadow Mapping (SM)

_Hard Shadow_

#### Percentage-Closer Filtering (PCF)

_PCF, same sampling range_

#### Percentage-Cloer Soft Shadows (PCSS)

_PCSS, adaptive sampling range_


### Comparison of Key Parameters

<p style="color: gray;">Note: All results are rendered in PCF mode.</p>

#### Sample Numbers

The quality of image increased as samples per pixel (SPP) increased, at the expense of the time needed for rendering.

#### Sampling Methods

In this lab, we are provided with 2 sampling methods, the [Uniform Disk Sampling](https://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Monte_Carlo_Integration/2D_Sampling_with_Multidimensional_Transformations#SamplingaUnitDisk) (as Figure 13.10 (b) shown) and [Poission Disk Sampling](https://codepen.io/arkhamwjz/pen/MWbqJNG?editors=1010). As SPP increased, Poission Disk Sampling yields nicer result.
