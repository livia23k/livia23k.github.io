<p style="color:gray;"> Note: When the medium IOR is equal to 1.0 and refraction is present, the shadows on the floor appear jagged, which should be wrong. This is probably due to lack of edge case handling.</p>


#### Sampling Methods

Multiple Importance Sampling:

Splitting the samples between BSDF scatters and the surface area lights (or the environment light). This method benefits when we have scenes using continuous distributions like the Lambertian.
