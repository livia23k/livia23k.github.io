## Glossary

When we use malloc(), free(), realloc(), and calloc() in C, we are doing space allocate status changing on heap. The position and composition of heap in the main memory is as Fig.1.

_Fig.1 Memory and Heap Structure_

Heap is divided by linked blocks as Fig.2

_Fig.2 Implicit Link (on heap)_

Each block has a header, including the block size and allocation status (0 for  free, 1 for alloced), and the payload (content written). By using the header, we could distinguish blocks from blocks. The structure of the blocks is like an implicit link, which is not a linkde-list actually but looks like linking with the next block.
